# The parallelize parameter instructs INSPIRRED how to distribute jobs over the available processors.
# Allowed values are: no, qsub, bsub
# If 'no' is selected then all jobs will be ran serially. 
# If using qsub on a single, multi-core machine, then set the forceQsubPath to 'Yes'.
parallelize : qsub
forceQsubPath : Yes

# Debuging
# If this parameter is set to Yes than a number of intermediate temp files will be retained.

# This id is used to distinguish the sequencing run from other previous runs.
